# Stress-Level-Prediction using Deep Learning
Among mental health conditions, depression stands out as the most prevalent disorder. It is 
recognized that changes in motor activity serve as an indicator of depression. The utilization of 
'actigraph recordings' to capture motor activity has been established as a scientific method for 
monitoring the emotional state of individuals. Diverse researchers have undertaken 
endeavors in stress detection through the utilization of machine learning techniques. For instance, 
Masood and Alghamdi  employed CNN to discern stressful activities. In a separate study, 
stress detection was conducted by applying MLP and a 1D convnet. Sharma et al. introduced a 
model designed for stress level prediction. Nijhawan et al. presented a study wherein tweets 
were extracted, leveraging machine learning methods to identify users' mental distress. More 
recently, a comprehensive assessment involving four deep learning paradigms (MLP, CNN, RNN, 
and RNN with LSTM), along with two ML techniques (SVM and LR), was conducted on EEG data [13]. 
Our primary objectives encompass the individual implementation of diverse deep learning sequence 
modeling techniques, namely simple RNN , LSTM , and GRU , on the actigraph data to 
facilitate stress classification. We aim to substantiate the hypothesis that 'by monitoring acute 
stress levels through human movement and activity patterns, it is possible to identify chronic stress 
.Actigraphs, small wearable devices, record human movement and activity patterns using 
accelerometers to detect changes in acceleration. These devices are commonly used in research 
and clinical settings to monitor physical activity levels, sleep patterns, and related behaviors. 
Researchers and professionals can analyze the data to understand activity patterns, assess sleep 
quality, estimate caloric expenditure, categorize physical activity intensity, count steps, identify 
sedentary behavior, and even recognize different body postures.The data collected by an actigraph 
typically includes information such as acceleration measurements, time stamps, quantified activity 
instances, sleep trends, caloric usage, levels of physical activity, step tallies, inactive behavior, and 
recognition of body position. Through a series of extensive experiments, we sought to establish the 
viability of applying different deep learning techniques to motion data.
